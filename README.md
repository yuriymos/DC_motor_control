The name of the progect is DC motor control.

Autor: Moskalev Yuriy.
This program was written using C.

In order to DC motor control used microcontroller ATmega16A.

DC motor power is 500 Wt.

The project includes some files:
1) Scheme for DC motor control using ATmega16A.
2) Scheme for the printed circuit board.
3) Program for DC motor control (C programming language).

When the system is running, user set armature rotation speed,
which remains constant when the load moment changes.
